A drama free, user-driven, stability based jailbreak for iOS 12.0-12.1.2 (Powered By jelbrekLib)

This jailbreak was written to be the most stable and easiest to use jailbreak for A11 and below (A12 Coming Soon). It was designed to give the user a choice with their device and will soon have the ability to choose between Substitute (Sileo) or Substrate (Cydia).
Made by @Chr0nicT and his amazing team.
